           American Dream Project<br>
		  ------------------------
		 <p> This project that my group and I worked on was about us finding a social issue and then making a social action plan to fix that issue. 
		     The issue that we chose was to let people be aware about the treatment foster children get in foster homes. 
			 Then we can help these kids for their futures. The way we helped was we went to two major cities in los angeles and gathered statistics by asking the civilian population on what they think about the issue.
             Later on from the data that we collected we put it into graphs and charts.

		    Checkerboard Project<br>
			--------------------
		<p> This project we used bootstrap. What bootstrap is it is just something that contains HTML- and CSS-based design.
	        We used this for our checkboard as well and to make and fix the checker board we needed to use a form of html and css and edit it on notepad ++.
			Also bootstrap has a grid system that has 12 colunms that makes it a more organized way.
